# Moodify

A web app that is essentially like a very stripped-down "Facebook for GIF's", wherein users can post GIF's(animation and stickers) to public and other user walls, as well as their own walls. Used Giphy's API to retrieve GIF's from their database in JSON format. We also implemented a basic login and authorization feature.

This app was made by [Armen Avanesi](https://github.com/armen115) and [Adrian Manteza](https://github.com/AdManteza) and 
for our midterm project at Lighthouse Labs (Web Development Immersive - July 2016).

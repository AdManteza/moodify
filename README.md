# Moodify

A web app that is essentially like a very stripped-down "Facebook for GIF's", wherein users can post GIF's(animation and stickers) to public and other user walls, as well as their own walls. Used Giphy's API to retrieve GIF's from their database in JSON format. We also implemented a basic login and authorization feature.

This app was made by [Armen Avanesi](https://github.com/armen115) and [Adrian Manteza](https://github.com/AdManteza) for our midterm project at Lighthouse Labs (Web Development Immersive - July 2016).

## Usage

1. On the public wall you can indicate your current mood by typing at the search bar, selecting either stickers or gifs, and    then let the app give you some stickers or gifs from Giphy based on your current mood.

2. By signing up and logging in you can post 4 stickers on your own wall or other users' wall, by typing 4 search terms that
will then be evaluated by the Giphy API and it will display the corresponding stickers.
